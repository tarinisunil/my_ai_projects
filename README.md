# 🚀 Exploring LLMs, Agentic AI, LangChain, and RAG  

Welcome to my personal playground for learning, experimenting, and building projects around **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Agentic AI**, **LangChain**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and all things AI!  

This repository is a reflection of my curiosity and ongoing journey in the world of modern AI technologies. Here, I experiment with different tools, frameworks, and concepts, and gradually build small projects to deepen my understanding.

## 📚 What I’m Learning and Exploring  

- **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Understanding how state-of-the-art language models work and how to effectively use them in applications.  
- **Agentic AI:** Experimenting with autonomous agents that can plan, act, and reason using LLMs.  
- **LangChain:** Learning how to build pipelines, chains, and applications that integrate LLMs with other data sources.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Exploring techniques to combine external knowledge sources with LLMs for more accurate and context-aware responses.  
- **Other AI concepts:** Knowledge graphs, embeddings, prompt engineering, memory systems, and AI-driven automation.

## 🛠 Projects and Experiments  

This repo will host:  

- Small demos of LangChain chains and agents.  
- Experimentation with RAG pipelines for question-answering and knowledge retrieval.  
- Custom scripts and notebooks exploring LLM behavior, prompt optimization, and embeddings.  
- AI agents performing tasks autonomously based on structured and unstructured data.

## 💡 Goals  

- Build a **hands-on understanding** of modern AI and LLM ecosystems.  
- Document learnings and experiments to share insights with others.  
- Gradually evolve experiments into small projects or production-ready demos.

## 📝 Notes  

This is very much a **learning-in-progress repository**. Code may be experimental, messy, or partially complete — that’s all part of the journey!  

If you’re exploring similar areas, feel free to **fork, star, or contribute**, and let’s learn together!
